# MATLAB Function with Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple MATLAB function with missing error handling and provides a solution with improved robustness.

## Bug

The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that performs a calculation based on the input value.  However, it doesn't handle potential errors or edge cases, leading to unexpected results or crashes for certain inputs. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to improve the function by adding error handling. It gracefully handles invalid inputs and provides informative error messages.
